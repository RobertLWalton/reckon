{section}First Example

{p}This is the first paragraph of the first
        example.  And
its second sentence.  Line indentation does not
matter in this paragraph, which is ended by the
                                next blank line.

{p}This paragraph contains a quote:
    // In text, `:' can start an indented paragraph.

    {quote}
    Remember to begin at
    the beginning and go to the end.  This quote
                  is a paragraph by itself.
        Within the paragraph, indentation does not
    matter as long as it is at least the paragraph
           indent.
    // Comments do not end the paragraph, as they
    // are not blank lines.
    So this is the last sentence in the paragraph.

{code} // This is needed to end text and return to code.
       // Otherwise the next line would begin with an
       // implied `{p}'.

This is a line of code:
   // In code, `:' can start an indented paragraph.
   This is a logical code
       line of the indented paragraph.
   And a second logical code line.

   {p}But we can have a text paragraph in an indented
   code paragraph.

   {code}This is the third logical line of code.

   {p}Another piece of text.
And a logical line of code that ends the indented
    paragraph.

{section}Second Example

{p: indent = 5}
This is the first paragraph of
    the second example.

This is the next paragraph, which begins
with an implied `{p: indent = 5}', and which
   contains a quote:

    {quote}Simplify, simplify, SMPLFY!

This is the third paragraph of the section.  It begins
with an implied `{p: indent = 5}'.

{code}
This is a line of code.  If it was not preceeded by
     or begun with `{code}', it would begin with
     an implied `{p: indent = 5}'.
