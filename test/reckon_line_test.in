This is a first logical line;;; and a second

    logical line;
And a third logical line.

This is a logical line.
And another
    logical line.
And a logical line ending with an indented paragraph:

    The first logical line of the
        indented paragraph.

    // A comment line that is ignored.
    The second logical line
        of the indented paragraph.
    The third logical line of the indented
        paragraph containing an indented
	subparagraph:
	// A comment that sets the indented subparagraph
	// paragraph indent.

	// The following comment will issue a warning:
	// Comment beginning non-comment logical line.

	    Line 1 of the subparagraph.

	Line 2 of the subparagraph.

    The fourth logical line of the indented paragraph.
// Two comment lines that end the indented paragraph but
// are otherwise ignored.
The logical line after the indented paragraph.  This would
    end the indented paragraph provided the two comment
    lines above did not exist.
