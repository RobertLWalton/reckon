This is a first logical line; and a second logical line;
And a third logical line.

This is a first logical line;;
a second logical line; and a third logical line;

This is a logical line.
And another
    logical line.
And a logical line ending with an indented paragraph:

    The first logical line of the
        indented paragraph.

    // A comment line that is ignored.
    The second logical line
        of the indented paragraph.
    The third logical line of the indented
        paragraph containing an indented
	subparagraph:
	// A comment that sets the indented subparagraph
	// paragraph indent.  A warning will be issued
	// because this comment begins a non-comment
	// logical line, but the comment is otherwise
	// ignored.

	    Line 1 of the subparagraph.

	Line 2 of the subparagraph.

    The fourth logical line of the indented paragraph.
// Two comment lines that end the indented paragraph but
// are otherwise ignored.
The logical line after the indented paragraph.  This would
    end the indented paragraph if the two comment lines
    above did not exist.
