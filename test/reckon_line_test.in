This is a first logical line; and a second logical line;
And a third logical line.

This is a first logical line;;
a second logical line; and a third logical line;

This is a logical line.
And another
    logical line.
And a logical line ending with an indented paragraph:

    The first logical line of the
        indented paragraph.

    // A comment line that is ignored.
    The second logical line
        of the indented paragraph.
    The third logical line of the indented
        paragraph containing an indented
	subparagraph:
	// A comment that sets the indented subparagraph
	// paragraph indent.  A warning will be issued
	// because this comment begins a non-comment
	// logical line, but the comment is otherwise
	// ignored.

	    Line 1 of the subparagraph.

	Line 2 of the subparagraph.

    The fourth logical line of the indented paragraph.
// Two comment lines that end the indented paragraph but
// are otherwise ignored.
The logical line after the indented paragraph.  This would
    end the indented paragraph if the two comment lines
    above did not exist.

{section}First Example

{p}This is the first paragraph of the first
        example.  And
its second sentence.  Line indentation does not
matter in this paragraph, which is ended by the
                                next blank line.

{p}
This paragraph contains a quote:
    // In text, `:' can start an indented paragraph.

    {quote}
    Remember to begin at
    the beginning and go to the end.  This quote
                  is a paragraph by itself.
        Within the paragraph, indentation does not
    matter as long as it is at least the paragraph
           indent.
    // Comments do not end the paragraph, as they
    // are not blank lines.
    So this is the last sentence of the paragraph.

{code} // This is needed to end text and return to code.
       // Otherwise the next line would begin with an
       // implied `{p}'.

This is a line of code.
