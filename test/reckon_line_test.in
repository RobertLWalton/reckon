This is a first logical line;;; and a second

    logical line;
And a third logical line.

This is a logical line.
And another
    logical line.
And a logical line ending with an indented paragraph:

    The first logical line of the
        indented paragraph.

    // A comment line that is ignored.
    The second logical line
        of the indented paragraph.
    The third logical line of the indented
        paragraph containing an indented
	subparagraph:
	// A comment that sets the indented subparagraph
	// paragraph indent.

	// The following comment will issue a warning:
	// Comment beginning non-comment logical line.

	    Line 1 of the subparagraph.

	Line 2 of the subparagraph.

    The fourth logical line of the indented paragraph.
// Two comment lines that end the indented paragraph but
// are otherwise ignored.
The logical line after the indented paragraph.  This would
    end the indented paragraph provided the two comment
    lines above did not exist.

{section}First Example

{p}This is the first paragraph of the first
        example.  And
its second sentence.  Line indentation does not
matter in this paragraph, which is ended by the
                                next blank line.

{p}
This paragraph contains a quote:
    // In text, `:' can start an indented paragraph.

    {quote}
    Remember to begin at
    the beginning and go to the end.  This quote
                  is a paragraph by itself.
        Within the paragraph, indentation does not
    matter as long as it is at least the paragraph
           indent.
    // Comments do not end the paragraph, as they
    // are not blank lines.
    So this is the last sentence of the paragraph.

{code}
// This is needed to end text and return to code.
// Otherwise the next line would begin with an
// implied `{p}'.  However, `{code}' must appear on
// a line by itself (code lines are NOT of `code'
// type).

This is a line of code:
    // In code, `:' can start an indented paragraph.
    This is a logical code
         line of the indented paragraph.
    And a second logical code line.

    {p}But we can have a text paragraph in an indented
    code paragraph.

    {code}
    This is the third logical line of code.

    {p}And another piece of text.
And a logical line of code that ends the indented
    paragraph.

{section}Second Example

{p: indent = 5}
This is the first paragraph of
     the second example.

This is the next paragraph, which begins
with an implied `{p: indent = 5}', and which
     contains a quote:

     {quote}Simplify, simplify, SMPLFY!

This is the third paragraph of the section.  It begins
with an implied `{p: indent = 5}'.

{code}
This is a line of code.  If it was not preceded by
     `{code}', it would begin with an implied
     `{p: indent = 5}'.
