{section}First Example

{p}This is the first paragraph of the first
        example.  And
its second sentence.  Line indentation does not
matter in this paragraph, which is ended by the
                                next blank line.

{p}This paragraph contains a quote:

    {quote} // In text, `:'s do not introduce indented
            // paragraphs, but you can still use comments,
            // and you can indent the input paragraph 
            // as you like.
            Remember to begin at
            the beginning and go to the end.  This quote
                          is a paragraph by itself.

{code} // This is needed to end text and return to code.
       // Otherwise the next line would begin with an
       // implied `{quote}'.

This is a line of code:
   And this is a logical line of an indented paragraph.
   And a second logical line.
   // In code, `:' can start an indented paragraph.

   {p}But we can have a text paragraph in an indented
      paragraph.

   {code}This is the third logical line of code.

   {p}Another piece of text.
And a logical line of code that ends the indented
    paragraph.

{section}Second Example

{p}
This it the first paragraph of
    the second example.

This is the next paragraph, which begins
with an implied `{p}', and which
   contains a quote:

{quote}Simplify, simplify.

{p}
This is the third paragraph of the section.  If it
did not begin with `{p}', it would begin with an
implied `{quote}'.

{code}
This is a line of code.  If is was not preceeded by
or begin with `{code}', it would begin with an implied
`{p}'.
