{section}First Example

{p}This is the first paragraph of the first
        example.  And
its second sentence.  Line indentation does not
matter in this paragraph, which is ended by the
                                next blank line.

{p}This paragraph contains a quote:
    // In text, `:' can start an indented paragraph.

    {quote} // This quote appears at the end of the
            // logical line containing it.
            Remember to begin at
            the beginning and go to the end.  This quote
                          is a paragraph by itself.

{code} // This is needed to end text and return to code.
       // Otherwise the next line would begin with an
       // implied `{quote}'.

This is a line of code:
   // In code, `:' can start an indented paragraph.
   This is a logical code
       line of the indented paragraph.
   And a second logical code line.

   {p}But we can have a text paragraph in an indented
      code paragraph.

   {code}This is the third logical line of code.

   {p}Another piece of text.
And a logical line of code that ends the indented
    paragraph.

{section}Second Example

{p}
This is the first paragraph of
    the second example.

This is the next paragraph, which begins
with an implied `{p}', and which
   introduces a quote:

    {quote}Simplify, simplify.

This is the third paragraph of the section.  It begins
with an implied `{p}'.

{code}
This is a line of code.  If is was not preceeded by
     or begin with `{code}', it would begin with
     an implied `{p}'.
