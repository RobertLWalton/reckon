<h2 id='single-variable-expression-assignments'>
    Single Variable Expression Assignments</h2>

<p>
Examples:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>X = 25</div>25
<div class='line'>next X = X + 10</div>35
<div class='line'>X</div>35
</pre>
<p>
A simple assignment consists of a variable name (e.g., <code>X</code>)
followed by the assignment operator (i.e., <code>=</code>)
followed by an expression (e.g., <code>25</code> or <code>X + 1</code>).
Storage for the variable named, which is called the
<b>assignment variable</b>, is allocated,
the expression, which is called the <b>assignment expression</b>,
is evaluated, and the expression value is store in the
variable storage.  The name of the newly allocated assignment variable does not
become visible until after the statement (i.e., in <code>X + 10</code>
above, <code>X</code> refers to the variable allocated by
<code>X = 25</code>).
<p>
The value of an assignment variable cannot be changed by later
statements.  But a new variable
of the same name can be created, and this will hide the old variable.
To do this, the variable name must be preceded by <code>next</code>
in the assignment for the new variable (e.g., <code>next X</code>).
<p>
More Examples:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>X = 5</div>5
<div class='line'>Z = 8</div>8
<div class='line'>Y = Z</div>8
<div class='line'>
Y = 10
    // It is illegal to reassign Y.</div><div class='error-line'>ERROR: in line 17: NON-next variable `Y' has a predecessor of the same
       variable name and lexical level:</div><div class='error-highlight'>Y</div> = 10
[no output due to compile error]
<div class='line'>next Y = 10
    // It is legal to assign a next Y.</div>10
<div class='line'>
next Z = - Z</div>-8
<div class='line'>next Z = X + Z</div>-3
<div class='line'>next Z = X + Y - Z</div>18
<div class='line'>next Z = X + ( Y - Z )</div>-3
</pre>
</p>

<h2 id='multi-variable-expression-assignments'>
    Multi-Variable Expression Assignments</h2>

<p>
Examples:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>X, Y = 5, 10</div>5
10
<div class='line'>next X, next Y = X + Y, X * Y</div>15
50
</pre>
<p>
A multi-variable expression assignment statement consists of
a comma-separated list of assignment variable names (e.g., <code>X, Y</code>)
followed by the assignment operator (i.e., <code>=</code>)
followed by a comma-separated list of assignment expressions.  The number
of assignment variables must equal the number of assignment expressions.
 Storage is allocated for the assignment variables,
then the assignment expressions are evaulated,
and then the expression values are stored in the variable storage.
The value of the first expression is stored in the first variable,
the value of the second expression is stored in the second variable,
and so forth.
The names of the newly allocated assignment variables do not
become visible until after the statement (i.e., in <code>X + Y</code>
and <code>X * Y</code> above,
<code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> refer to the variables allocated by
<code>X, Y = 5, 10</code>).
<p>
Just as in the single variable case, the
values of assignment variables cannot be changed by subsequent,
but new variables of the same name can be created and hide the old variables
using <code>next</code>.
<p>
More Examples:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>M, N = 5, 10
    // The values of M and N are printed in order
    // after the statement</div>5
10
<div class='line'>next M, next N = N, M</div>10
5
<div class='line'>P, Q = M * N, M + N</div>50
15
<div class='line'>R, next P = P / Q, P + 1</div>3.33333333333333

<h2 id='block-assignments'>Block Assignments</h2>

<p>
Example:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>E, F =:
    E = 25
    F = -25</div>25
-25
</pre>
<p>
A block assignment is like a single variable or multi-variable
expression assignment except that the assignment expressions to the right of
the <code>=</code> are replace by a
<a href='reckon_logical_lines.html#blocks'>block</a>.
<p>
The assignment variables on the left side of the <code>=</code>
(e.g., <code>E</code> and <code>F</code>) are allocated
and made write-only inside the block.  Statements inside the block
(e.g., <code>E = 25</code> and <code>F = -25</code>)
can then write values into these variable.  However these
values cannot be read by statements inside the block.  Statements
subsequent to the block assignment statement cannot change the
values of these variables.
<p>
If <code>next V</code> is an assignment variable of a block assignment
statement, then inside the block <code>V</code> can be read and refers to
the value of <code>V</code> just before the block assignment statement
starts to execute.
<p>
The initial value of a non-<code>next</code> assignment variable
is zero, so if the variable is not written in the block its value will
be zero.  The initial value of a <code>next</code> assignment variable
is the value of the variable of the same name before the block
assignment statement starts to execute, and so if the variable is not
written in the block, the effect is to not change the value of the variable.
<p>
An assigment variable of a block assignment statement can be written
more than once by statements in the block.  The last write is the one
that determines the variable value after the block assignment statement
finishes.
<p>
More Examples:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>E, F =:
    E = 25
    F = -25</div>25
-25
<div class='line'>
E, F // Outputs first the value of E and then the value of F.</div>25
-25
<div class='line'>
next E, next F do:
    // The `do' here is cosmetic and has no effect.
    next E = 35
       // This does not take effect until after
       // this block has executed
    next F = E
       // The value of E is the value before the
       // block executes</div>35
25
<div class='line'>
E, F</div>35
25
<div class='line'>
J, K = do:
    J = E
    K = J + 1
        // J is write-only inside this block</div><div class='error-line'
>ERROR: in line 60: cannot read write-only variable:</div
>    K = <div class='error-highlight'>J</div> + 1

<h2 id='if-statements'>If Statements</h2>

<p>
An example:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>S = 25</div>25
<div class='line'>next S =:
    if S > 20: next S = 20</div>20
<div class='line'>S</div>20
</pre>
<p>
The first form of if-statement is a control operator
(<code>if</code>, <code>else if</code>, or <code>else</code>)
followed by a condition operand (<code>S &gt; 20</code> in the example;
omitted in the case of <code>else</code>)
followed by a colon operator (<code>:</code>) followed by a
restricted statement (<code>next S = 20</code> in the example).
 The condition operand is evaluated to a truth
value (see <a href='reckon_logical_operators.html'>Logical Operators</a>)
and if <code>*TRUE*</code> the restricted statement is executed.
<p>
Restricted statements cannot have operators of precedence 0000
(e.g., cannot be if-statements) and cannot allocate variables to
storage.  Because of the latter, most restricted statements must be
in blocks so they can write write-only variables (<code>next S</code>
in the example).  It implies that if-statements must be in blocks.
<p>
If-statements may be grouped as follows.
The group begins with a statement with operator <code>if</code>.
This is followed by zero or more statements with
operator <code>else if</code>, and these are followed optionally by a
statement with operator <code>else</code>.  If the condition
operand of one of these statements evaluates to <code>*TRUE*</code>,
the remaining statements in the group are skipped and not executed.
If no condition operand evaluates to <code>*TRUE*</code>, the
restricted statement in the <code>else</code> statement ending
the group executes (that is, if group actually ends with an <code>else</code>
statement).
<p>
In the second form of if-statement the colon operator and
restricted statement are replaced by a
<a href='reckon_logical_lines.html#blocks'>block</a>.
 The block is executed
only if the condition operand evaluates to <code>*TRUE*</code>,
or if the block ends an <code>else</code> statement that is executed.
<p>
More examples:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>S = 25</div>25
<div class='line'>next S =:
    if S > 20: next S = 20
        // S = 20 is a restricted statement.  It is an
        // operand of `if ... : ... ' and cannot have
        // operators with precedence 0000.  It cannot
        // allocate variables, but can write variables
        // that are write-only.</div>20
<div class='line'>S</div>20
<div class='line'>
T = 25</div>25

    if T < 0: SIGN T = -1
    else if T == 0: SIGN T = 0

<div class='line'>
next T = do:
    if T < -20:
        JX = 5        // Allocates JX to block.
        next T = -20   // Just writes next SIGN T.
        // JX is deallocated here (end of its block)
    else if T > 20:
        JX = 6
        next T = 20</div>20
<div class='line'>T</div>20
<div class='line'>JX    // JX has been deallocated.</div

<h2 id='next-variable-implication'>Next Variable Implication</h2>

<p>
Example:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>next D = do:
    next D = D + 10
</pre>
<p>
is equivalent to:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>do:
    next D = D + 10
</pre>
<p>
The use of <code>next V</code> as an assignment variable of a
block assignment statement can be implied by its use as an
assignment variable of any statement inside the block, for
any variable <code>V</code>.
<p>
More examples:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>D = 95</div>95
<div class='line'>do:
    // In `next D = do' the next D is implied by the
    // following statement.
    next D = D + 10</div>105
<div class='line'>D</div>105
<div class='line'>do:
    // In `next D = do' the next D is implied by the
    // statement `next D = 33'.

    JX = 50
    do:
        // In `next JX = do' the next JX is implied by
        // the statement `next JX = 60'.

        next D = 33
        next JX = 60
    // JX is deallocated here</div>33
<div class='line'>D</div>33
