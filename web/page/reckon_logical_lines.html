<p>
The <i><a href='reckon_lexemes.html'>lexemes</a></i>
in a RECKON source file are organized into
<i>physical-lines</i>, <i>logical-lines</i>, and <i>blocks</i>.
</p>

<h2 id='physical-lines'>Physical Lines</h2>

<p>
A <u>non-blank</u> <em>physical-line</em> begins with
an <i>indent</i> lexeme that is followed by a lexeme
that cannot be an <i>indent</i>, <i>line-break</i>,
or <i>end-of-file</i>.  Every <i>physical-line</i> ends with a
<i>line-break</i> or <i>end-of-file</i> lexeme, and does not
contain any <i>indent</i> lexeme other than one beginning
the <i>physical-line</i> if the latter is non-blank.

<p>
A <u>blank</u> <i>physical-line</i> contains nothing but a
<i>line-break</i> or <i>end-of-file</i> lexeme.

<p>
The indentation of a non-blank <i>physical-line</i> is the indentation of
its <i>indent</i> lexeme.

<p>
Indentation is important. A warning message is output if the
indents of two <i>physical-lines</i>
that are being compared differ by more than <b>0</b>
and less than <b>2</b> columns.  This detects indentation
mistakes.

<p>
The indentation of the first non-blank <i>physical-line</i> must be <b>0</b>.
</p>

<h2 id='logical-lines'>Logical Lines</h2>

<p>
A <em>logical-line</em> begins just after an <i>indent</i> lexeme and
the indent of the <i>logical-line</i> is the indent of this lexeme.
A <i>logical-line</i> ends with any of:
<ol>
<li> an <i>indent</i> lexeme with indent equal to or less indent than the
     <i>logical-line</i> beginning <i>indent</i> lexeme
<li> just before a blank line in the context where the
     <i>logical-line</i> is also
     a <a href='reckon_text.html#text-paragraph'><i>text-paragraph</i></a>
     (if the <i>logical-line</i> is a code statement, blank lines
     are ignored) 
<li> an <i>end-of-file</i> lexeme
</ol>

<p>
It is an error for the first <i>logical-line</i> of a file to have
an indent greater than <b>0</b>.

<p>
A non-blank <i>physical-line</i> that is part of a <i>logical-line</i> but is
not the first such is called a
<em>continuation-line</em> and must have an indent greater than the indent
of the <i>logical-line</i>.

<p>
A <i>logical-line</i> that contains <i>comment</i> lexemes, but no other
lexemes except for <i>line-breaks</i>, <i>indents</i>, and
<i>end-of-files</i>, is called a <em>comment-line</em>.

<p>
It is an error to begin non-comment <i>logical-lines</i> with a
<i>comment</i> lexeme. <i>Comment</i> lexemes can be used
freely in the middle of or at the end of any <i>logical-line</i>,
or at the beginning of a <i>comment-line</i>.

<p>
Examples of <i>logical-lines</i> that are <i>code-statements</i> are:
<pre class='example'>
This is a first logical line.
This is a second logical line
    with a continuation line.
This is a third logical line

    with an ignored blank line.
// The third logical line is ended by this
    // comment line.  This comment line is the
    // fourth logical line, but will become an empty
    // statement and then be ignored.
This is the fifth logical line, but it will generate
 a warning message because this continuation line
  is insufficiently indented.
</pre>

<p>
After a <i>logical-line</i> has been formed, any <i>indent</i>,
<i>comment</i>, <i>line-break</i>, and <i>end-of-file</i> lexemes
in the <i>logical-line</i> are removed from the <i>logical-line</i>.
If the result is empty, e.g., the <i>logical-line</i>
is a <i>comment-line</i>, it is discarded.
</p>

<h2 id='blocks'>Blocks</h2>

<p>
A <i>logical-line</i> may end with a <em>block</em>
that is itself a sequence of <i>logical-lines</i> that have indents
greater than the indent of the <i>logical-line</i>
containing the <i>block</i>. The <i>block</i> is introduced by
a ‘<em>:</em>’ at the end of a <i>physical-line</i>, provided the ‘:’
is not inside brackets or quotes (e.g.,
not inside ( ) or ‘ ’). If the first <i>indent</i> lexeme after
the ‘:’ has an indent that is not
greater than the indent of the <i>logical-line</i> containing
the ‘:’, the <i>block</i> is empty. Otherwise
the indent of this <i>indent</i> lexeme becomes the indent of
the <i>block</i> and the indent of all the
<i>logical-lines</i> in the <i>block</i>. The first <i>logical-line</i>
of the <i>block</i> starts immediately after this
indent lexeme. The <i>block</i> ends just before the first
<i>logical-line</i> with lesser indent than the
<i>block</i> indent, or the end of file. More specifically,
the last <i>logical-line</i> of the <i>block</i> ends with
an <i>indent</i> whose indent is less than the <i>block</i>
indent, or with an <i>end-of-file</i>.

<p>
Examples of <i>blocks</i> at the ends of <i>logical-lines</i> are:
<pre class='example'>
this is a top level logical line ending with a block:
    this is the first line of the block
    this is the
        second line of the block
    this is the third line of the block:
        this is the first line of a subblock
        this is the second line
                of the subblock:
            this is the only line of a sub-subblock
        this is the third line of the subblock
    this is the fourth line
            of the block:
        this is the only line of the second subblock
    this is the fifth line of the block
        and it ends with an empty subblock:
this is the second top level
    logical line
</pre>

<p>
A <i>block</i> can be ended by an insufficiently indented <i>comment-line</i>
(i.e., <i>block</i> endings are determined before <i>comments</i> are
discarded).
It is an error for a <i>block</i> to be in the middle of a <i>logical-line</i>.
This means that the first <i>indent</i>
following the <i>block</i> must have an indent no greater than
that of the <i>logical-line</i> containing the <i>block</i>.
Some examples involving these rules are:
<pre class='example'>
// this is a logical line that is a single comment

// this is a logical line that has two
    // comments

this is a logical line // with a comment
    // and another comment
    with three comments // and a last comment

this is a logical line ending with a block:
    First line of the block
    Second line of the block
// Comment that ends block
// Comment that is in error because
    it begins a logical line that this continues

this is a logical line with a block:
    First line of the block
    Second line of the block
  but the block is in error because it is before
  this continuation of the logical line that contains
  the block

this is a logical line ending with a block:
    First line of the block
    Second line of the block
  // comments that end the block, but are in error,
  // because they continue the logical line
  // containing the block
</pre>

</p>

<h2 id='statements'>Statements</h2>

<p>
In a code file, the <i>logical-lines</i> are
called <em>statements</em>.  Top level <I>statements</i>,
i.e., those outside <i>blocks</i>, must have indent 0.

<p>
Therefore a code file is a sequence of top-level <i>statements</i>.

<p>
Since a <i>logical-line</i> can end with a <i>block</i> that
itself consists of a sequence of <i>logical-lines</i>, a
<i>statement</i> can end with a <i>block</i> that itself
consists of a sequence of <i>statements</i>.
