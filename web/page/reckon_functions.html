<h1 id='text-header'>RECKON Functions</h1>

<p>
A <b id='function'>function</b> is a block of code that when
called executes.
The call can pass values called <b id='argument'>arguments</b>
to the block and the block can return values
called <b id='return-value'>return values</b> to the call.
The code block can have <b id='side-effect'>side effects</b>
which change program data not referenced
by the arguments.

<p>
A complete set of all the examples for this page is in
<a href='../examples/reckon_functions.rec' download>
<code>reckon_functions.rec </code></a>.

<h2 id='function-declarations'>Function Declarations</h2>

<p>
Examples:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>function add (X) (Y):
    Z = X + Y
    return Z

Z = add (5) (7)</div>12
<div class='line'>function (X) add (Y): return X + Y

next Z = (5) add (7)</div>12
<div class='line'>function add (X, Y): return X + Y

next Z = add ( 5, 7 )</div>12
</pre>

<p>
Functions are defined by
<b id='function-declaration'>function declarations</b>
that consist of the word `<code>function</code>'
followed by a <b id='function-prototype'>function prototype</b>
followed by a colon `<code>:</code>' followed by
either a 
<a href='reckon_assignments.html#restricted-statement'>restricted statement</a>
or a <a href='reckon_logical_lines.html#blocks'>block</a>.
The restricted statement or block is executed when the function is called.
A <code/>return</code> statement in a function block returns a value
to a call of the function.  A function restricted statement may be
a return statement that returns a value to a call.
<p>
A call to the function typically looks like the function prototype,
except that arguments in the prototype are variable names
called <b id='argument-names'>argument names</b>, while arguments
in the call are expressions which are evaluated to produce argument
values passed by the call to the restricted statement or block executed
by the function.  In the restricted statement or block an argument name
can be used to access the associated argument value passed by the call.
<p>
Calls to a function must occur after the declaration of the function.
A function F2 may be declared <u>inside</u> the code block of a function
F1, in which case calls to F2 must be inside this code block
and after the declaration of F2.

Examples:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>function sum from (X) to (Y):
    S = 0
    while X &lt;= Y:
        next S + = X
        next X + = 1

<div class='line'>function sum (L):

<p>
A function prototype is an sequence of <b id='term-name'>term names</b>
and argument lists.  A term name is a sequence of words, natural numbers,
marks, and separators not beginning with a natural number.
In the prototype, marks and separators must be <code>"</code>
quoted, and words may optionally be <code>"</code> quoted.
The term names of a prototype
of a function must match those of a call to the function exactly,
except that <code>"</code> quotes are removed from the term names in the
call.
<p>
A term name and the argument lists that follow it (before the next term name)
are called a <b id='term'>term</b>.  Each term in a call is matched to
the term in the prototype that has the same term name.  However, the
terms in the call may be in a different order than the terms in the
prototype, except that the first call term name must match the first
prototype term name.
<p>
A function does not need to have any term names provided it has
at least two argument lists, nor does it need to
have any argument lists if it has one term name.

Another Example:
<pre class='example'>
<div class='line'>function (X) (Y): return X[Y]
L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</div>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
<div class='line'>(L)(3)</div>4
